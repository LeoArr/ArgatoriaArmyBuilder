## Collaborate

Feel free to collaborate, reach out to me with any questions.

Currently it needs:

- More armies. Some manual data entry into `assets/armies.js`
- Cool graphics. Cool graphics is always cool. For example a favicon.
- Proofreading. Are all the stats correct? Are the rules correct? etc.
